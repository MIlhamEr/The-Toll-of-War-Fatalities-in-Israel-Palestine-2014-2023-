# The Toll of War Fatalities in Israel Palestine (2014-2023)
This collaborative project, conducted as part of a data visualization class, sought to offer a comprehensive visual overview of the loss of life resulting from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. My role involved actively contributing to the creation of impactful graphics and collectively analyzing the results with fellow team members. This experience significantly enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively in a group environment.
